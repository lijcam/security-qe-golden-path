# Secure Build Pipeline Demonstrator: Guiding You Along Golden Pathways to Secure Software Deployment

Welcome to the Secure Build Pipeline Demonstrator! ðŸš€ In the realm of software development, having a well-defined and secure route from code creation to production deployment is invaluable. This project acts as your guide along those "golden pathways" â€” structured processes that ensure your software is safe, dependable, and thoroughly traceable.

## The Power of Golden Pathways

Imagine software development as a journey where well-charted paths lead to success. Just as travelers follow established routes, your software needs a dependable path from its source code to its final deployment. This "golden pathway" guarantees that your applications are constructed securely and systematically, adhering to best practices at every step.

## Navigating the Secure Build Pipeline

At the core of this initiative is the Secure Build Pipeline Demonstratorâ€”a practical example that showcases how to establish your own dependable deployment process. Here's what it offers:

1. **Commit Verification:** The journey starts with validating Git commits. Only code that passes rigorous GPG verification gains access to the secure deployment process.

2. **Dockerfile-Based Builds:** If you're familiar with Dockerfiles, you're in luck. Our demonstrator seamlessly integrates Dockerfile-based builds into the process.

3. **Vulnerability Assessment:** Prioritising software security is paramount. We use Red Hat's Advanced Cluster Security scanner to identify vulnerabilities and furnish actionable reports.

4. **Utilising Syft:** Employ Syft to generate a comprehensive inventory of your software's componentsâ€”a transparent look at what constitutes your application.

5. **Ensuring Transparency:** Ever wondered about an image's origins? Our build process captures essential details like commit authorship and dates, offering a clear journey from initial code to the final image.

## Getting Started

To kick off your journey with the Secure Build Pipeline Demonstrator, follow these steps:

1. **Install Operators:**

   Start by installing the operators that drive the Secure Build Pipeline. Run the following command:

```
oc apply -f openshift-subscriptions.yaml
```

2. **Install Supporting Components (Optional):**

   If you're testing this on a single cluster, consider installing the supporting components. Execute this command:

```
oc apply -f auxiliary-pipeline-systems.yaml
```

3. **Setup Required Services:**
   
   You'll need to set up specific services as per the directions provided in the [Config/README.md](Config/README.md) guide.

4. **Apply the Pipeline:**
   
   Lastly, apply the secure pipeline to your cluster. Use the following command:

```
oc apply -f secure-pipeline.yaml
```
